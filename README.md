# Benchmarker

### macro trainer | build order optimizer | practice tool

Benchmarker is the Starcraft 2 practice tool you’ve been waiting for. This tool aims to help players of all levels refine and improve their macro mechanics while at the same time practicing the builds they will need to slay all the nerds and steal their ladder points.

**Features:**

Reset builds on the fly without having to remake a custom game.

Track personal supply benchmarks by matchup in-game
- Set supply benchmarks at 6, 8, and 10 minutes
- Set time benchmark for reaching 200/200 supply
- Benchmarks are automatically saved for future practice sessions
- Benchmarks are tracked separately for each match-up so you can switch between builds quickly and easily

Practice against "benchmark" build orders to refine and optimize your play
- Save your best build orders (per matchup) at the end of each build
- Track your play against a set of "benchmark" build order objectives for real-time feedback
- See real-time “hints” for upcoming build order steps in game

Display customizable alerts designed to help players get into the rhythm of macroing correctly.  
- Alert when your minerals or gas becomes too high
- Alert when you are about to be supply blocked
- Alert when your race’s macro-mechanic energy gets too high
- Alert when you are forgetting upgrades for too long
- Alert when worker or army production is idle for too long
- Alert when your APM goes below a certain threshold for too long
- Alert when your army has been sitting idle on the map for too long

Provide performance reports after each build to help you create and refine the perfect build order
- Reports on supply benchmark performance
- Reports number of workers created
- Reports amount of time supply blocked
- Reports amount of time production is idle
- Reports total army size/value/supply
- Reports build order steps from current build
- Reports Spending Quotient (SQ) from Do you macro like a pro? (unimplemented)
- Reports average unspent minerals (unimplemented)
- Reports average unspent gas (unimplemented)

In-Game Stats to track your progress in real time
- Provide performance reports after each build to help you create and refine the perfect build order

A [WIN] button... because who doesn’t want a win button?

Supports chat commands and hotkeys for accessing menus in game

*Note - The beta is being released only on Overgrowth LE at the moment for testing purposes.  However, the full release version will support all current ladder pool maps.*
